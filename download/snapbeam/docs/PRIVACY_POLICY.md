# SnapBeam Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2025*

## Introduction

SnapBeam ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### What We DO NOT Collect
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers.
- **No Accounts**: SnapBeam does not require user accounts, so we have no user database.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics services or tracking tools.
- **No Advertising**: We do not display ads or share data with advertisers.

### What We Temporarily Store
- **Photos**: Photos you share are stored temporarily on our servers (Cloudflare R2/KV) for the purpose of delivering them to your connected devices. Photos are automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity.
- **Connection Codes**: Random 8-character codes used to link devices. These are not linked to any personal information.
- **Captions**: Optional text messages attached to photos, stored with the photos and deleted together.

## How Information Is Used

The limited data we temporarily store is used solely for:
1. Delivering photos between connected devices
2. Displaying photos on home screen widgets
3. Maintaining connection functionality

## Data Storage

All data is stored on Cloudflare's infrastructure:
- **Location**: Data centers in the EU and US
- **Encryption**: All data transfers use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Retention**: Maximum 30 days of inactivity

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties. The only "sharing" that occurs is:
- Photos you send are delivered to devices that have your connection code
- Connection codes are only as secure as you keep them

## Children's Privacy

SnapBeam is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information, we are compliant with COPPA and similar regulations.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal information, there's no personal data to:
- Access
- Delete
- Modify
- Export

To remove all your data, simply:
1. Open SnapBeam
2. Go to Settings
3. Tap "Disconnect"

This will remove your connection and all associated photos from our servers.

## Security

- **Connection Codes**: 8-character random codes that are hard to guess
- **HTTPS**: All communications are encrypted
- **No Authentication**: No passwords to steal or lose
- **Temporary Storage**: Data is automatically cleaned up

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users through the App of any material changes.

## Summary

**TL;DR**: We don't collect any personal information. Photos are temporarily stored to deliver them to your loved ones and are automatically deleted. No accounts, no tracking, no ads.
